# "Algorithmic Toolbox" Solutions. 
Here you can find all my solutions on the course, of course you can use it as reference but remember the code of conduct of Coursera.

Due to a mistake merging the solutions made with cpp, and those made with golang, I've lost all the solutions made with golang between the week 1 and the week 3.
